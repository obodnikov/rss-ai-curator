# Shown Articles Tracking - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 What Changed

Previously, articles were filtered by whether they had feedback (`like`/`dislike`). This meant:
- ❌ Articles could be re-ranked and shown multiple times
- ❌ You had to rate every article to prevent re-showing
- ❌ No way to mark "seen but neutral" articles

**Now:**
- ✅ Articles are marked as "shown" when sent in digest
- ✅ Shown articles are NEVER re-ranked or re-sent
- ✅ You can still change ratings on shown articles
- ✅ Only fresh, unseen articles go through LLM ranking

## 📋 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update Code Files

Replace these files with the updated versions:

1. **`src/database.py`** - Adds `shown_to_user` and `shown_at` fields
2. **`src/scheduler.py`** - Marks articles as shown after sending digest
3. **`src/telegram_bot.py`** - Uses `shown_to_user` filter instead of feedback check

### Step 2: Run Migration Script

The migration script adds new columns to existing database:

```bash
# Save the migration script as migrate_add_shown_field.py
python migrate_add_shown_field.py
```

**What it does:**
- Adds `shown_to_user` column (Boolean, default False)
- Adds `shown_at` column (DateTime, nullable)
- Creates index on `shown_to_user` for performance
- Marks articles with existing feedback as "shown" (prevents re-ranking)

**Expected output:**
```
==============================================================
  RSS AI Curator - Database Migration
  Add shown_to_user tracking
==============================================================

📦 Migrating database: data/rss_curator.db
🔧 Adding shown_to_user column...
🔧 Adding shown_at column...

🔧 Marking articles with feedback as shown...
✅ Migration complete!
   • Added shown_to_user column
   • Added shown_at column
   • Created index
   • Marked 42 articles with feedback as shown

==============================================================
  Next steps:
  1. Restart your bot: python main.py start
  2. Articles won't be re-ranked after being shown
  3. You can still change ratings via 👍/👎 buttons
==============================================================
```

### Step 3: Restart Bot

```bash
# Stop current bot (Ctrl+C)
# Start with new code
python main.py start
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Digest Generation Flow

```
1. Fetch articles from RSS feeds
   ↓
2. Filter: WHERE shown_to_user = False
   ↓
3. Create embeddings
   ↓
4. Filter by similarity (if training data exists)
   ↓
5. Balanced selection by source
   ↓
6. LLM ranks candidates
   ↓
7. Filter by min_score_to_show
   ↓
8. Send top articles to Telegram
   ↓
9. Mark articles as shown:
   - shown_to_user = True
   - shown_at = current_timestamp
   ↓
10. These articles NEVER re-ranked!
```

### Rating Shown Articles

When you click 👍 or 👎 on a shown article:
- ✅ Feedback is recorded (like before)
- ✅ Used for training future rankings (like before)
- ✅ Article stays marked as shown (NEW!)
- ✅ Will NOT appear in future digests (NEW!)

## 📊 Statistics Changes

### Before Migration
```
📊 Your Preference Stats

👍 Liked: 42 articles
👎 Disliked: 18 articles
📰 Total articles: 1,247
🗑️ Cleaned up: 856 articles
💾 Database size: 15.3 MB
```

### After Migration
```
📊 Your Preference Stats

👁️ Shown: 127 articles          ← NEW!
👍 Liked: 42 articles
👎 Disliked: 18 articles
📰 Total articles: 1,247
🗑️ Cleaned up: 856 articles
💾 Database size: 15.3 MB

ℹ️ Shown articles won't be re-ranked in future digests
```

## 🐛 Debug Information Changes

### Before Migration
```
🔍 Debug Information

Database:
• Total articles: 1,247
• Pending (unrated): 89
• Liked: 42
• Disliked: 18
```

### After Migration
```
🔍 Debug Information

Database:
• Total articles: 1,247
• Pending (not shown): 89      ← Changed!
• Shown to user: 1,158         ← NEW!
• Liked: 42
• Disliked: 18
```

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Migration Success

```bash
# Connect to database
sqlite3 data/rss_curator.db

# Check new columns exist
.schema articles

# Should show:
# shown_to_user BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0
# shown_at DATETIME
```

### Query Shown Articles

```sql
-- Count shown vs pending
SELECT 
  shown_to_user,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM articles
GROUP BY shown_to_user;

-- Results:
-- 0|89    (pending)
-- 1|1158  (shown)
```

### Check Index

```sql
-- List indexes
.indexes articles

-- Should include:
-- idx_articles_shown_to_user
```

## 🎨 User Experience Changes

### What You'll Notice

**Immediately after migration:**
- All previously rated articles marked as "shown"
- Next `/digest` only shows NEW articles
- No more repeats of articles you've already seen!

**Going forward:**
- Every digest shows only fresh articles
- Articles you've seen but not rated = "shown, neutral"
- These won't appear again (no need to rate!)
- Only rate articles you have strong feelings about

## 📈 Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: First Digest After Migration
```
/digest
→ Shows 10 new articles (not shown before)
→ All 10 marked as shown
→ You rate 3 as 👍, 2 as 👎
→ Other 5 stay "shown but neutral"
```

### Scenario 2: Second Digest
```
/digest
→ Only considers articles with shown_to_user = False
→ Learns from your 3 likes + 2 dislikes
→ Shows 10 new articles
→ Previous 5 neutral articles NOT re-ranked
```

### Scenario 3: Changing Your Mind
```
→ You see an old article in Telegram history
→ Click 👍 to like it (changing from neutral)
→ Feedback recorded
→ Article STAYS shown (won't re-rank)
→ Future rankings learn from this like
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No pending articles"

**Cause:** All articles marked as shown

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fetch new articles
/fetch

# Then try digest
/digest
```

### Issue: "Migration says already applied"

**Check if it worked:**
```bash
sqlite3 data/rss_curator.db "PRAGMA table_info(articles)" | grep shown
```

Should show:
```
9|shown_to_user|BOOLEAN|0|0|0
10|shown_at|DATETIME|0||0
```

### Issue: "Articles still repeating"

**Possible causes:**
1. Migration didn't run → Run `python migrate_add_shown_field.py`
2. Using old code → Update `scheduler.py` and `telegram_bot.py`
3. Cache issue → Restart bot completely

**Check logs:**
```bash
tail -20 logs/rss_curator.log | grep "marked as shown"
```

Should see:
```
INFO: Articles marked as shown: 10
```

## 🎯 Performance Impact

### Database Queries

**Before (slow):**
```sql
-- Check if article has feedback
SELECT * FROM articles a
LEFT JOIN feedback f ON a.id = f.article_id
WHERE f.id IS NULL
```

**After (fast):**
```sql
-- Simple boolean check with index
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE shown_to_user = 0
```

**Speed improvement:** ~3-5x faster for large datasets

### Storage

- Each article: +1 byte (boolean) + 8 bytes (timestamp)
- 1,000 articles: ~9 KB additional storage
- Negligible impact

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Manually Mark Article as Shown

```python
# In Python console or script
from src.database import DatabaseManager, Article
from datetime import datetime

db_manager = DatabaseManager(config)
db = db_manager.get_session()

# Mark article ID 123 as shown
article = db.query(Article).filter(Article.id == 123).first()
article.shown_to_user = True
article.shown_at = datetime.utcnow()
db.commit()
```

### Reset All Shown Status

```sql
-- CAUTION: This will re-enable ranking for all articles!
UPDATE articles SET shown_to_user = 0, shown_at = NULL;
```

### Find Articles Shown But Not Rated

```sql
SELECT a.id, a.title, a.shown_at
FROM articles a
LEFT JOIN feedback f ON a.id = f.article_id
WHERE a.shown_to_user = 1 AND f.id IS NULL
ORDER BY a.shown_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
