## Why These Feeds Stand Out

**‚úÖ All Verified Working:** Every feed tested October 2025 with confirmed RSS XML

**Clinical + Technical Balance:** Sources bridge medical practice and AI technology, offering insights valuable to both clinicians and technologists.

**Implementation Focus:** Heavy emphasis on real-world deployments, case studies, and practical applications rather than pure research.

**Regulatory Awareness:** Coverage includes compliance, approval processes, and ethical considerations in medical AI.

**Russian Market Depth:** Strong representation of Russian healthcare AI ecosystem, essential for understanding one of the world's rapidly developing digital health markets.

**Active Development:** All feeds actively maintained with recent posts, representing current state-of-the-art in AI healthcare applications.

## RSS Setup Tips for Healthcare

1. **Combine with research alerts:** Use PubMed RSS for specific topics:
   ```
   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/[YOUR_SEARCH_QUERY]
   ```

2. **Regional filtering:** Separate US/UK/Russian healthcare news if targeting specific markets

3. **Clinical vs. Business:** Tag feeds by audience (clinical staff vs. hospital IT vs. health tech investors)

4. **Compliance tracking:** Set up keyword alerts for FDA, CE Mark, Roszdravnadzor announcements

5. **Vendor monitoring:** Follow key players (Epic, Cerner, SberMed) via their announcement feeds

## Healthcare-Specific Challenges

**Why so few RSS feeds in healthcare?**

1. **HIPAA/GDPR concerns:** Many organizations avoid automated feeds
2. **Commercialization:** Content moved to paid newsletters
3. **Platform shift:** Organizations use LinkedIn/Twitter instead
4. **Compliance burden:** RSS feeds seen as uncontrolled data distribution

**Workaround strategies:**

- Use RSS-to-Email services (Feedrabbit, Blogtrottr)
- Set up Google Alerts for key topics
- Use web scraping tools (with permission)
- Subscribe to official newsletters and auto-forward to RSS bridge
