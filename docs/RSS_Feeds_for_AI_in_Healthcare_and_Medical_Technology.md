## Why These Feeds Stand Out

**Clinical + Technical Balance:** Sources bridge medical practice and AI technology, offering insights valuable to both clinicians and technologists.

**Implementation Focus:** Heavy emphasis on real-world deployments, case studies, and practical applications rather than pure research.

**Regulatory Awareness:** Coverage includes compliance, approval processes (FDA, Roszdravnadzor), and ethical considerations in medical AI.

**Russian Market Depth:** Strong representation of Russian healthcare AI ecosystem, essential for understanding one of the world's rapidly developing digital health markets.

**Diverse Perspectives:** Mix of academic institutions (Stanford, MIT), government agencies (NLM, MinZdrav), industry players (SberMedAI, Webiomed), and specialized health IT media.

**Active Development:** All feeds actively maintained with recent content, representing current state-of-the-art in AI healthcare applications.

## RSS Setup Tips

1. **Custom PubMed Feeds:** Create searches like `("artificial intelligence"[MeSH] OR "machine learning"[Title]) AND "medicine"[MeSH]` then save as RSS
2. **Language Filters:** Most RSS readers allow filtering by language if you want to separate English/Russian content  
3. **Topic Alerts:** Set up keyword alerts in readers for specific interests (radiology AI, clinical decision support, etc.)
4. **Update Frequency:** Balance daily news feeds (Healthcare IT News) with weekly deep-dives (Stanford AIMI, Webiomed)
