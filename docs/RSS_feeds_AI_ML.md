## Why These Feeds Stand Out

**Depth over frequency:** Every feed prioritizes substantive, well-researched content over quick news aggregation. Posts range from comprehensive tutorials to research deep-dives to thoughtful analysis.

**Practitioner and researcher voices:** Most are written by active researchers, engineers, or scientists rather than journalists, providing insider perspectives and technical authenticity.

**Balance achieved:** Content sits in the sweet spot between academic papers and pop-sci articles—technical enough to learn real concepts, accessible enough to understand without specialized training.

**Language distribution:** 8 English and 5 Russian sources provide strong coverage in both languages, with particular strength in English AI content and Russian interdisciplinary science.

**Active and verified:** All RSS feeds were verified as active with recent posts. No defunct or abandoned blogs included.
