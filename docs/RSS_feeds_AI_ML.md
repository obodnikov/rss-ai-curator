## Why These Feeds Stand Out

**âœ… Verified Active:** All 11 feeds tested October 2025 and confirmed working

**Depth over frequency:** Every feed prioritizes substantive, well-researched content over quick news aggregation. Posts range from comprehensive tutorials to research deep-dives to thoughtful analysis.

**Practitioner and researcher voices:** Most are written by active researchers, engineers, or scientists rather than journalists, providing insider perspectives and technical authenticity.

**Balance achieved:** Content sits in the sweet spot between academic papers and pop-sci articlesâ€”technical enough to learn real concepts, accessible enough to understand without specialized training.

**Language distribution:** 7 English and 4 Russian sources provide strong coverage in both languages, with particular strength in English AI content and Russian interdisciplinary science.

## RSS Setup Tips

1. **Test feeds first:** Use `curl` or browser to verify XML: 
   ```bash
   curl -I https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/feed.xml
   ```

2. **Use feed readers:** Feedly, Inoreader, NewsBlur, or self-hosted options like FreshRSS

3. **Language filters:** Most RSS readers allow filtering by language if you want to separate English/Russian content

4. **Update frequency:** Balance daily news feeds (Habr, Elementy) with weekly deep-dives (CMU ML Blog, Chip Huyen)

5. **Backup strategy:** Save OPML export of your feeds monthly
