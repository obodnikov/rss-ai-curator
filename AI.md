# AI Coding Rules (Python Repo)

- Follow **PEP8** basics, use type hints where obvious.
- Keep files **short (~800 lines max)**.
- Functions should be **self-contained** with clear names.
- Add docstrings only for public functions/classes.
- Prefer pytest for new tests, but minimal tests are okay.
- Use logging, not print, for errors.
- Donâ€™t add new dependencies without a clear reason.
